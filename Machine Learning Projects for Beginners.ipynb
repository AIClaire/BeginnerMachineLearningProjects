    "# Machine Learning Projects for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "In this repo you will find links to different machine learning projects that you can try out as a beginner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the steps identified in the Machine Learning Step by Step Guide to help you solve these different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These projects have been chosen because of the range of skills they show and the datasets are a manageable size. The dataset size means that they are easy to practise on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a good project that you think should be added here please do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project 1: Iris Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is one of the best entry level projects to help you get started with machine learning projects. In the project you are tasked with helping identify different types of Iris flowers from their petal dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Link to the data: \n",

    "\n",
    "## Project 3: Video Game Sales Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contains data for different video games that you will use to predict the sales of the video game. Pay close attention to the different columns of data you are given and make sure you know which should be inputs and which should be outputs of the algorithm!\n",

    "\n",
    "## Project 5: Customer Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I am giving you two options but your goal is the same. In this project you need to segment your customer data so that you can make predictions about purchases and target marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project 6: Stock Price Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will be able to choose a company from the various ones listed on the Indian Stock exchange and access their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the data you will use it to predict the stock price. This is a time series forecasting project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Link to the data: \n",
